# Design Patterns

They can be classified in 3 groups.
- Creational: this ones deal with the process of creation of objects of classes.
- Structural: this ones deal with how classes and objects are arranged or composed so to derive functionality out of them.
- Behavioral: this ones describe how classes and objects interact & communicate with each other

## Why Creational?

Sometime there are additional requirements or a process needs to take place for create an object.
Examples: And object needs other objects before it can be created. Or multiple steps needed before create an object (query url for data, or read data from a file).
