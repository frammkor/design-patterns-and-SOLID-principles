# Design Patterns

They can be classified in 3 groups.
- Creational: this ones deal with the process of creation of objects of classes.
- Structural: this ones deal with how classes and objects are arranged or composed so to derive functionality out of them.
- Behavioral: this ones describe how classes and objects interact & communicate with each other

## Creational?

Sometime there are additional requirements or a process needs to take place for create an object.
Examples: And object needs other objects before it can be created. Or multiple steps needed before create an object (query url for data, or read data from a file).

### Creational Patterns that will be studied

- Builder
- Simple Factory
- Factory Method
- Prototype
- Singleton
- Abstract Factory
- Object Pool

## Structural

Structural patterns deal with how classes and objects are arranged or composed.
Composition and Inheritance can be combined to create arrangements to solve common problems.

### Structural Patterns that will be studied

- Adapter
- Bridge
- Decorator
- Composite
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

## Behavioral 

Behavioral patterns describe how classes and objects interact & communicate with each other.

### Behavioral Patterns that will be studied

- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Mediator
- Iterator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor
- Null Object
