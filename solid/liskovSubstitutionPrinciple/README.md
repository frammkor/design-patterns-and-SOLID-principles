Liskov Substitution Principle

We should be to substitute base class objects with child class objects & this should not alter behavior / characteristics of the program.

In this example, when defining the Square class we are overriding the behavior originally set by the extended class Rectangle. Altering the program result and not following the Liskov Principle.

The way to solve this problem is to break this relationship.
